# Astro Crash Course

Go to [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) for detailed info.

Check out [Astro Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/astro-deploy): This action for Astro builds your Astro project for GitHub Pages. Also the last action on the Actions page is for Astro: Deploy an Astro site but it's not the 1st one.

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Usage

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying       |
| `npm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro preview` |
| `npm run astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                       |
